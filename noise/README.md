# SimplexNoise
A simplex noise implementation in python. Follows the implementation found [here](http://webstaff.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/simplexnoise.pdf).
The package contains both 2D and 3D simplex noise implementations as well as an implementation of 1D Perlin noise. 

Run the example code to generate an image within the present working directory. Install by running `pip install -e . -r requirements.txt` while within the current directoy. A requirements file has been provided and should run any present code.
